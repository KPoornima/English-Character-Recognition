# English-Character-Recognition
#Handwritten English Character Recognition using CNNs and Dense NNs in Keras

• Aim is to train the machine to correctly identify the letters of the English alphabet (written in capital).

• Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Dense Neural Nets to train the model.

• Achieved a very high accuracy rate (~99%).
