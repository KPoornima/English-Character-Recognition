# English-Letter-Recognition-using-CNN
Handwritten English Letter Recognition using CNNs and Dense NNs in Keras

• Aim - To train the model to correctly identify the letters of the English alphabet (written in capital).

• Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Dense Neural Nets to train the model.

• Achieved a very high accuracy rate (>98%).

• Dataset contains 372450 images of handwritten capitalized English letters with a pixel resolution of 28x28  

• Created using Google Colabs
