# English-Character-Recognition
Handwritten English Character Recognition using CNNs and Dense NNs in Keras

• Aim - To train the model to correctly identify the letters of the English alphabet (written in capital).

• Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Dense Neural Nets to train the model.

• Achieved a very high accuracy rate (>98%).
